# ProbentApps

This project is a web application streamlining the processes of order fulfilment and invoicing.

The application is meant to be used by sales accounts managers to track the work done for their orders, delivery and progress reports from clients, as well invoicing status.
Employees of accounting departments also use the application to track and notify sales about their invoice requests.

## Design and motivation

This project was initiated in 2025 for the Probent company in collaboration with their parent corporation, Eiffage Energy Systems - Clemssy Services.

The application is designed around the premise of facilitating communication between sales and accounting departments,
ensuring that all necessary information is readily available and easily accessible for invoicing.

Additional features like order progress tracking and client feedback are included to enhance the overall workflow and efficiency of the sales process,
and were included based on the feedback from the sales team.
